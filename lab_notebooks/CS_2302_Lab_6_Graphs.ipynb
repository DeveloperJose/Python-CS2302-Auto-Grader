However, for your report submission, you  are more than welcome to extend your colab to include what is required for the report. Alternatively, you can use any other text editor to write your lab report (Google Docs, Word, etc.). I personally recommend to stick to Google Colab as you can write code to draw the required plots, which makes the whole process simpler. \n",

        "You have a fox, a chicken and a sack of grain. You must cross a river with only one of them at a time. If you leave the fox with the chicken he will eat it; if you leave the chicken with the grain he will eat it. How can you get all three across safely? In this problem, you are asked to implement a solution that uses a graph search algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s represent the state of the world with four bits ⟨b0,b1,b2,b3⟩. Bit b0 represents the location of the fox, b1 represents the location of the chicken, b2 represents the location of the grain, and b3 represents your location. We will assume you are going from the left side to the right side of the river, thus for a particular bit bi, bi == 0 means the corresponding entity (fox, chicken, grain, or person) is on the left side of the river and bi == 1 means the entity is on the right side. We can represent states by nodes in a graph G = (V, E). Thus V = {⟨0,0,0,0⟩,⟨0,0,0,1⟩,...,⟨1,1,1,0⟩,⟨1,1,1,1⟩}, or you could use the decimal representations of the bit vector and thus V = {0, 1, ..., 14, 15}. Legal transitions between legal states will be represented by undirected edges in that graph. A transition is legal if the person moves from one side of the river to the other and is accompanied by zero or one other entities. A state is not legal if the fox can eat the chicken or the chicken can eat the grain, as explained above, otherwise it is legal. Thus (⟨0, 0, 0, 0⟩, ⟨0, 1, 0, 1⟩) ∈ E, corresponding to the person crossing the river with the chicken, while (⟨0, 0, 0, 0⟩, ⟨0, 0, 1, 1⟩)  is not in E, since ⟨0, 0, 1, 1⟩ is not a legal state (the fox eats the chicken).\n",

        "We can now find the solution to the problem by finding a path going from state ⟨0, 0, 0, 0⟩ to state ⟨1, 1, 1, 1⟩ in the graph. Your task is to implement six different solutions to the problem the three graph representations (adjacency list, adjacency matrix and edge list) and two search algorithms (breadth-first search and depth-first search).\n"
