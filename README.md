# CS2302 Auto-Grader
An automatic grading system for Python code submitted on Blackboard. It works by providing annotations that you can put on top of your solution file functions. Once you get the hang of it, you can grade multiple course sections in a few seconds after spending a few minutes annotating the solutions.

To get an in-depth look at what this grader can do, how it works, and how to use it, please read the tutorial found in the notebook named **tutorial.ipynb**
