However, for your report submission, you  are more than welcome to extend your colab to include what is required for the report. Alternatively, you can use any other text editor to write your lab report (Google Docs, Word, etc.). I personally recommend to stick to Google Colab as you can write code to draw the required plots, which makes the whole process simpler. \n",

The idea is that when an operation is performed, you use the dictionary to access the node in constant time, and using the properties of the doubly linked list, you can relocate it. The purpose of the doubly linked list is to keep track of the order in which the nodes have been accessed. \n",

In this problem, you are asked to write another solution to the problem that uses a heap to find the *k* most used passwords (in descending order). When sorting, sort the passwords by the number of times they appear in the data set. If two passwords have the same frequency, the password with lower alphabetical order should come first. Your solution must use a heap (coded by yourself) and a dictionary (the one that comes with Python). If your code takes a long time to run, only use a subset of the passwords. \n",
